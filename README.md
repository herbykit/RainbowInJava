# RainbowInJava
A Java port of https://github.com/EnderBon/rainbow


To run this program, open the provided jar file with Java 1.8 or higher.


Use of this program:
To change the main color for the scheme, slide each of the sliders to where you want them 
or put in specific numbers you want for your preferred color. To see the additional 4 colors
that go with each scheme format, use the buttons at the top to choose which scheme you wish
to use. If you change the background color, it stays at the scheme that was last selected.
When the program is first run, it is set to the monochrome scheme.


Later additions:
- Changing the background color to the color of the panel on the right clicked
- Bar for saving color schemes
- Ability to save and load schemes from a file (likely CSV with BGCOLOR,SCHEME)
